\ref ANDISOL is the "public face" of the lowest levels of the Rift Valley Platform. It encapsulates the model (database or server connections), and provides an object-based, functional model to the implementation layers.

\ref COBRA is the security administration toolbox for the Rift Valley Platform. It is only available to logged-in users that are "manager" users; capable of editing other users.

\ref CHAMELEON is the "First Layer Abstraction" from the data storage and retrieval. It implements a few higher-level capabilities, such as collections, users and places.

\ref BADGER is the "First Layer Connection" to the data storage subsystem. It uses [PHP PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) to abstract from the databases, and provide SQL-injection protection through the use of [PHP PDO Prepared Statements](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php).
