INTRODUCTION
============

The Baseline Plugin is a basic \ref BASALT [REST](https://restfulapi.net) Plugin; part of the "standard" set.

You use this plugin to view and manage security tokens, list plugins, and do "non-denominational" searches on the BAOBAB server.

USAGE
=====

This plugin is accessed by setting `"baseline"` as the Command in the [REST](https://restfulapi.net) URI. There are a number of other aspects to the URI that will be explained:

    {GET | POST} http[s]://{SERVER URL}/{json | xml | xsd}/baseline/[{search | tokens | serverinfo}/[?[search_radius= & search_longitude= & search_latitude=] | search_name= | search_tag0= | ... | search_tag9=]

SERVER URL
----------

    http[s]://{SERVER URL}/
    
This is the base URL to the BAOBAB executable (which will eventually end up calling \ref `entrypoint.php`).

RESPONSE TYPE
-------------

This is the requested response type. It is required, and will generally be either `"json"` or `"xml"`, depending on what type of response you want.

It can also be `"xsd"`, but be aware that specifying this will ignore all other parameters, and simply return the XML for the plugin's schema.

TYPES OF RECORDS
----------------

The plugin will return the following information:

- plugins

    A simple list of available plugins (usually "baseline", "people", "places", and "things"). The response will be an array of string.
    
- tokens

    These are the actual security tokens visible to the currently logged-in user. The response will be an array of integers.
    
- results
    
    These are IDs of data objects that fit within the search criteria given (and are visible to the current user). These will be delivered in an assocative array of integer arrays.

GET CALLS
---------

No Command
----------

    {GET} http[s]://{SERVER URL}/{json | xml | xsd}/baseline
    
When called with `"xml"` or `"json"` as response types, this will simply return a list of the available plugins (usually "baseline," "people," "places," and "things").

When called with `"xsd"` as the response type, this will return the XML XSD document for this plugin. The schema is comprehensive, specifying all possible response types.

tokens
------

    {GET} http[s]://{SERVER URL}/{json | xml}/baseline/tokens

This will return a simple array of integers, listing the security tokens available to the current logged-in user. Calling this when not logged in will result in a 403 (FORBIDDEN) error.

The login ID of the current user is always the first element of the array.

search
------

    {GET} http[s]://{SERVER URL}/{json | xml}/baseline/search[?[search_radius= & search_longitude= & search_latitude=] | search_name= | search_tag0= | ... | search_tag9=]

This allows for specialization, using the URI search specification modifiers. Calling it without these modifiers will return the entire visible database.

The response is an associative array (the keys are the plugin names), containing simple arrays of integers. Each integer is the resource ID of a resource visible to the current user.

The available search specifiers are:

- `search_name=`

- `search_tag0=`, `search_tag1=`, `search_tag2=`, `search_tag3=`, `search_tag4=`, `search_tag5=`, `search_tag6=`, `search_tag7=`, `search_tag8=`, `search_tag9=`

These are all text specifiers, and should have the `=` followed by text. Leaving this blank specifies that you want only records that have that field blank. If you use more than one of the `search_tag` specifiers, they act in an AND fashion, with each one narrowing the search.

It should be noted that the various tags have different default functions, based upon the plugin. For example, in the `people` plugin, the first eight tags are used for names, and in the `places` plugin, the first eight tags are used for address information. In the `things` plugin, `tag0` is used to hold the key to look up the resource.

- `search_radius=`
- `search_longitude=`
- `search_latitude=`

These must all be specified together in order for location searches to work. This can be used in conjunction with the above string searches.

Every resource type in the BAOBAB server can (but is not required to) have a location, denothed by a long/lat pair. If there is a location, it can be found, using this search.

These should all be followed by floating point numbers. `search_radius` is the *radius* (not diameter) of a circle, with the location specified by the `search_longitude` and `search_latitude` query arguments, which are a long/lat location (in degrees).

serverinfo
----------

    {GET} http[s]://{SERVER URL}/{json | xml}/baseline/serverinfo

This will return a structure, containing various server settings and information, such as versions and enabled features.

It is only accessible if you are logged in with the "God" admin.
